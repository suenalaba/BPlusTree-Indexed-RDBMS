# Linux Setup and Installation guide

1. Clone this repository using `git clone https://github.com/suenalaba/BPlusTree-Indexed-RDBMS.git` or unzip the zip folder.
2. `cd` to the folder and open the project in Visual Studio Code using `code .`
3. Ensure that you have a C++ compiler. (g++ for Linux)

- Run `g++ --version` and a version should show up if your compiler exist.
- Ensure your compiler is able to support `C++11`
- Most linux distributions will have g++ installed out of the box, but if your distribution does not have, you can follow this link: (https://www.maketecheasier.com/use-g-plus-plus-compiler-linux/)

4. Ensure all C++ files are included in compilation by:

1. Click on `terminal` and then -> `configure default build task`
1. Include the following in `tasks.json` to ensure all C++ files are compiled on build:

```
"tasks": [
  {
      "type": "cppbuild",
      "label": "C/C++: g++ build active file",
      "command": "/usr/bin/g++",
      "args": [
        "-g",
        "${fileDirname}/*.cpp",
        "-o",
        "${fileDirname}/${fileBasenameNoExtension}",
        "-std=c++11"
      ],
      "options": {
        "cwd": "${fileDirname}"
      },
      "problemMatcher": [
        "$gcc"
      ],
      "group": {
        "kind": "build",
        "isDefault": true
      },
      "detail": "Task generated by Debugger."
    }
]
```

5. <b>IMPORTANT<b>: Ensure that your active file is `main.cpp` (It is the one selected.)
6. Open terminal and select `run build task` with the `main.cpp` file selected and select your C++ Compiler(g++)
7. After successful compilation you should see: `Build finished successfully.`
8. Open a new terminal and run `./main`.
9. Select block size by inputting `1` or `2` accordingly.
10. If the compilation is successful, that should be the following user input prompt: <br> `Select Block Size (Enter 1 or 2): ` <br>
11. Upon selecting a block size by inputting `1` or `2`, something like this template will be printed (May differ based on Block Size Selected)

```
